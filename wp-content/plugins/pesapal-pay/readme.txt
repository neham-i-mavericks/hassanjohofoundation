PesaPal Pay allows you to easily integrate Pesapal to any ecommerce website

== Description ==

A quick way to integrate PesaPal to your website to handle the payment process. All you need to do is set up what parameters to capture from the form and the plugin will do the rest via the shortcode [pesapal_pay_button] where you can add the attribute button_name to be the text on the button. You can now alos accept donations via the PesaPal Donate Widget or using the shortcode [pesapal_donate].
There is now a meta box on a post of page to allow automatic shortcode addition.
You can manage the payment form by adding your own custom fields or arranging the form elements to suit your view
